# PortfolioOptimization
Optimization’s main goal can be determined as the “best” decision from a set of
possible decisions. What’s more applicable than to apply this concept in determining
which stocks to invest in? We have identified three different companies whose stock
listing prices have shown upward trends in the last month. Namely, these companies
are Disney, Netflix, and Eros. Our issue is to figure out how much of 1000$ to
invest in each of these three stocks that will provide an expected return of 50$.
